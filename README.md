**Requires:** [Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd5e)

This module implements my own additions and revisions of D&D 5e into Foundry, as well as some content from Mage Hand Press and official D&D sources that I use in my games.

Currently included content (number of subclasses listed after classes):

- Base Ancestries: Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc
- Planestouched Ancestries: Aasimar, Eladrin, Kalashtar, Shadar-Kai, Shifter, Tiefling
- Class Revisions: Barbarian (2/?), Cleric (2/?), Monk (2/?), Paladin (2/?)
- MHP Classes: Craftsman (1/12), Martyr (1/13), Witch (2/14)
- New Classes: Marshal (6/6)
- Spells: All PHB, TCE, and FTD spells; all XGE spells from levels 0-2; some additional spells from my own content.
- Talents: A small number of talents, an alternative to feats.
- Techniques: 70 Martial Techniques across 10 styles, with lists available to sort by class.

Changes from official content:

- Summon spells (Summon Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Shadowspawn, Undead) don't have prices listed for components.
- Smite-like spells (Ensnaring Strike, Hail of Thorns, Lightning Arrow; Banishing, Blinding, Searing, Staggering, Thunderous, Wrathful Smite) are cast as a bonus action when you hit, and don't require concentration if their effects are instantaneous. All smites can be upcast for extra damage.
- Conjure Barrage deals 5d8 damage (up from 3d8) and can be upcast.
- Healing Spirit heals 3 times per creature, rather than a set number of times.

WIP content:

- Spell lists: Still need to implement some cleric, martyr, paladin, and witch spells.
